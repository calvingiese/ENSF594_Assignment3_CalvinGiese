# ENSF594_Assignment3_CalvinGiese

This is a program that is used to read words from an input text file and print them in lists of anagrams on an output text file.

## Problem Satement

The goal of this assignment is to write a Java program that arranges a list of words into separate lists of anagrams. The input file is a list of words, 
each on its own line and could be a very long list. The program must read these words from the input file and print them to an output file.

## Design Specifications

The program should create a linked list for each set of anagrams and should disclude duplicate words from the list. The input text file can be assumed
to be "input.txt" and the output should be "output.txt" which means an interface for the user is unneccesary.

## Execution

For the program to execute, the input file should be populated with the list of words to sort through. Once this file is saved, run the program and the 
results will be saved to the output file with each list of anagrams on their own line.
